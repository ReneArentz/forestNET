This custom-built [forestNET Framework](https://forestany.net/fnet.php) in C#, developed in Visual Studio, is designed to streamline the development of robust applications by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and interfaces.

It offers seamless integration with console applications, efficient file handling solutions, and database management capabilities. Additionally, the framework supports both FTP and SFTP protocols for secure file transfers, and includes advanced features for socket programming, enabling smooth communication across networks. By combining these functionalities, the framework simplifies complex tasks, threading, enhancing developer productivity and application performance.

Following **database systems** will be supported by forestNET:

* MariaDB/MySQL
* SQLite3
* MSSQL
* OracleDB
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB

This framework is designed to be in sync with the corresponding *forestJ framework* in Java, ensuring both platforms offer the same functionality and capabilities. This alignment enables seamless interoperability between .NET and Java applications, allowing for smooth integration and consistent performance across diverse environments.

forestNET framework will be released under the **GPLv3 license** and the **MIT license**. Thus it is freely possible to use forestNET in other projects - projects with free software or in commercial projects.
